Today we're going to play with fractions. I'll ask many questions and I'm curious about your answers regardless of whether they're correct or not. Then we'll think together and discover why something is correct and something isn't.
</div>
<div class="teacher-dialog en">
The first question is: Why do we need fractions?
</div>
<div class="student-dialog en">
For example, because we want to divide pizza among ourselves.
</div>
<div class="teacher-dialog en">
Can we count fractions only from one whole thing, or can we find fractions from a larger number of things – for example, a quarter of eight books?
</div>
<div class="teacher-dialog en">
How do we find a quarter?
</div>
<div class="student-dialog en">
We need to divide the books into four equal groups.
</div>
<div class="teacher-dialog en">
Is it possible to find a quarter of five books? Can you think of a situation where that would make sense, and one where it wouldn't?
</div>
<div class="student-dialog en">
no response
</div>
<div class="student-dialog en">
It doesn't make sense if we want to give books to children, because we'd have to tear one apart. It makes sense if I want to read 5 books in four days and I'm asking how many books I need to read per day. Reading one and a quarter books per day makes sense.
</div>
<div class="teacher-dialog en">
Can you think of five other objects where using a quarter makes sense?
</div>
<div class="student-dialog en">
For example, five apples, because we can easily cut one apple into four pieces, while in the case of distributing books we don't want to destroy a book by dividing it into four parts.
</div>
<div class="student-dialog en">
We can divide books so that three get one book each and the fourth gets two.
</div>
<div class="teacher-dialog en">
Such division is possible, but those three will get a different fraction of five books than the fourth one. Fractions assume division into equal parts. A half is created when we divide a whole into two equal parts, a third when we divide a whole into three equal parts, a quarter by dividing into four equal parts, etc. The number of parts we divide the whole into determines the size of the fraction of that whole.
</div>
<div class="teacher-dialog en">
Why is it important to say "of that whole"?
</div>
<div class="student-dialog en">
no response
</div>
<div class="student-dialog en">
Because a quarter of students in one class has a different size than a quarter of students in the whole school.
</div>
<div class="student-dialog en">
And half of a small pizza has a different size than half of a large pizza.
</div>
<div class="teacher-dialog en">
Excellent example!
</div>
<div class="teacher-dialog en">
So we've found that fractions serve to divide something (which can be multiple objects, in mathematics we call this a set of objects) into equal parts. Then we can do something with one or several of these parts.
</div>
<div class="teacher-dialog en">
Imagine a family that buys a pizza, and mom and dad eat twice as much as two small children. How would you divide the pizza and what fraction would each of them eat?
</div>
<div class="student-dialog en">
I don't know
</div>
<div class="teacher-dialog en">
We can imagine that what one child eats is one piece of pizza. Then each parent eats two pieces of pizza. Now we count the number of pieces we need to divide the pizza into: 1+1+2+2=6
</div>
<div class="teacher-dialog en">
How many pieces we divide the whole into, in our case six, we remember in the bottom part of the fraction, and how many such parts someone gets we remember in the top part of the fraction.
</div>
<div class="student-dialog en">
I know now, each child gets 1/6 and each parent gets 2/6.
</div>
<div class="teacher-dialog en">
Excellent! Would you like to try another family, for example mom with three children?
</div>
<div class="student-dialog en">
...
</div>

<div class="teacher-dialog en">
The bottom part is called the denominator because it gives the fraction its name (e.g., third when we divided into three parts) and the top part is called the numerator and tells us how many such parts we use.
</div>
