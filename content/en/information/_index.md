## About the Project

We Want To Know is an educational project with mathematics activities focused on developing children's logical thinking. These are activities suitable for those who don't fully understand what they're doing when solving math problems, as well as for those who want to understand mathematics more deeply, like to ask questions, and enjoy searching for answers.
In the schedule, you can choose the type and level of activity to best match your expectations.

## Why Mathematics in Nature?

Nature provides an environment where children feel relaxed and don't perceive the activities they engage in as obligations.

## Our Approach

We learn by asking questions about a topic and searching for answers. Questions are asked by both the teacher and children if any come to mind. We search for answers together.
For a better understanding, we provide an [example](/en/fractions-from-basics/) of an activity on the topic 'Fractions from Basics'.

No textbooks, just curiosity and willingness to cooperate.
