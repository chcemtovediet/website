## About the Project

We Want To Know is an educational project focused on developing children's mathematical thinking through play and activities in nature. We draw inspiration from the pedagogical principles of Jan Amos Comenius, the father of modern pedagogy, who advocated learning through the senses and direct contact with the world.

## Why Mathematics in Nature?

Nature is full of mathematical patterns and principles. When children:
- Count pebbles by the stream, they learn basic arithmetic
- Observe symmetry in leaves, they discover geometry
- Measure a tree's shadow, they understand proportions
- Look for patterns in pine cones, they encounter the Fibonacci sequence

## Our Approach

We learn through play, experimentation, and discovery. No textbooks, just curiosity, joy, and nature as the best teacher.
