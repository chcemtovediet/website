Each activity follows the description provided below, but adapts to the questions and reactions of participating children. **It is important to join the activity at its beginning**, as it builds knowledge progressively and the teacher's questions build on previous content. You can leave the activity at any time.

**Parents are fully responsible for their children during the activity.**

**Location** of the activity is in the vicinity of the amphitheater and is marked with a sign saying "Chcem to vedieť" (I Want to Know).

## Activity Descriptions

### Fractions from Basics

An activity that builds the concept of fractions from scratch, explains their form, helps understand the meaning of numerator and denominator, shows the use of fractions with simple examples, and moves toward more complex examples based on questions and reactions of participating children.

### Equations from Basics

An activity that leads to understanding how an equation simplifies problem solving, what you need to know to construct it, and how to work with it to solve it. The complexity of examples adapts to the questions and reactions of participating children.

### Advanced Equations

An activity for children who understand what an equation is and know basic equation operations. We will explore several more complex equations and participants can suggest procedures for solving them, which we will discuss and justify their correctness, or explain why a certain step is incorrect.

### Geometry - Angles

An activity focused first on angles in general, we will explore relationships between angles in some geometric shapes and later we will explain why the sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees and we will explore shapes with more than three angles.

### Trigonometry in Right Triangles

An activity that explains what tangent, sine, and cosine are, why they were created, and how they are used. Examples will start from the simplest and will adapt to the questions of participating children.
