# Program

## Our Activities

### Mathematical Nature Walks

Regular trips into nature where children discover mathematics in the world around them. Each walk has a theme - geometry, numbers, patterns, measurement.

### Playful Workshops

Interactive workshops full of games, puzzles, and experiments. Children learn mathematical concepts without realizing they're learning.

### Nature Laboratories

We create spaces in nature where children can experiment, measure, compare, and discover mathematical principles at their own pace.

### Community Gatherings

We bring together families, educators, and enthusiasts who believe in the power of playful learning and nature pedagogy.

## Who is the Program For?

- Children aged 5-12 years
- Families seeking alternative forms of education
- Educators interested in nature-based and experimental learning
- Anyone who believes mathematics can be fun
